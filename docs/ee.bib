                  to examine the properties of econometric estimators
                  and tests. We present conditions for obtaining
                  cosistency and asymptotic normality of a very
                  general class of estimators (extremum
                  estimators). Consistent asymptotic variance
                  estimators are given to enable approximation of the
                  asymptotic distribution. Asymptotic efficiency is
                  another desirable property then
                  considered. Throughout the chapter, the general
                  results are also specialized to common econometric
                  estimators (e.g. MLE and GMM), and in specific
                  examples we work through the conditions for the
                  various results in detail. The results are also
                  extended to two-step estimators (with
                  finite-dimensional parameter estimation in the first
                  step), estimators derived from nonsmooth objective
                  functions, and semiparametric two-step estimators
                  (with nonparametric estimation of an
                  infinite-dimensional parameter in the first
                  step). Finally, the trinity of test statistics is
                  considered within the quite general setting of GMM
                  estimation, and numerous examples are given."

Its asymptotic χ2 distribution therefore holds under a wider set of circumstances, like weak instruments, than the standard full rank case for the expected Jacobian under which the asymptotic χ2 distributions of the traditional statistics are valid. The behavior of the K statistic can be spurious around inflection points and maxima of the objective function. This inadequacy is overcome by combining the K statistic with a statistic that tests the validity of the moment equations and by an extension of Moreira's (2003) conditional likelihood ratio statistic toward GMM. We conduct a power comparison to test for the risk aversion parameter in a stochastic discount factor model and construct its confidence set for observed consumption growth and asset return series.}

These tests are shown to be similar under weak-instrument asymptotics when the reduced-form covariance matrix is estimated and the errors are non-normal. The conditional test based on the likelihood ratio statistic is particularly simple and has good power properties. Like the score test, it is optimal under the usual local-to-null asymptotics, but it has better power when identification is weak.}

Researchers using matching methods often apply the bootstrap to calculate the standard errors. However, no formal justification has been provided for the use of the bootstrap in this setting. In this article, we show that the standard bootstrap is, in general, not valid for matching estimators, even in the simple case with a single continuous covariate where the estimator is root-N consistent and asymptotically normally distributed with zero asymptotic bias. Valid inferential methods in this setting are the analytic asymptotic variance estimator of Abadie and Imbens (2006a) as well as certain modifications of the standard bootstrap, like the subsampling methods in Politis and Romano (1994).}

The paper also extends results of Hall and Horowitz (1996) to provide new results regarding the higher-order improvements of the standard bootstrap and the k-step bootstrap for extremum estimators (compared to procedures based on first-order asymptotics). The results of the paper apply to Newton-Raphson (NR), default NR, line-search NR, and Gauss-Newton k-step bootstrap procedures. The results apply to the nonparametric iid bootstrap and nonoverlapping and overlapping block bootstraps. The results cover symmetric and equal-tailed two-sided t tests and confidence intervals, one-sided t tests and confidence intervals, Wald tests and confidence regions, and J tests of over-identifying restrictions.}

In particular, we consider using these methods directly to construct CI endpoints. By considering two very simple models, the paper shows that neither the bootstrap nor the m out of n bootstrap is valid in finite samples or in a uniform asymptotic sense in general when applied directly to construct CI endpoints. In contrast, other results in the literature show that other ways of applying the bootstrap, m out of n bootstrap, and subsampling do lead to uniformly asymptotically valid confidence sets in moment inequality models. Thus, the uniform asymptotic validity of resampling methods in moment inequality models depends on the way in which the resampling methods are employed.}

Methodology is developed in the context of the “equation” approach, which allows attention to be focussed on specific criteria for excellence, such as coverage error of a confidence interval or expected value of a bias-corrected estimator. This approach utilizes a definition of the bootstrap in which the key component is replacing a true distribution function by its empirical estimator. Our theory is Edgeworth expansion based, and is aimed specifically at elucidating properties of different methods for constructing bootstrap confidence intervals in a variety of settings. The reader interested in more detail than can be provided here is referred to the recent monograph of Hall (1992)."

abstract = "The bootstrap is a method for estimating the distribution of an estimator or test statistic by resampling one’s data or a model estimated from the data. Under conditions that hold in a wide variety of econometric applications, the bootstrap provides approximations to distributions of statistics, coverage probabilities of confidence intervals, and rejection probabilities of hypothesis tests that are more accurate than the approximations of first-order asymptotic distribution theory. The reductions in the differences between true and nominal coverage or rejection probabilities can be very large. The bootstrap is a practical technique that is ready for use in applications. This chapter explains and illustrates the usefulness and limitations of the bootstrap in contexts of interest in econometrics. The chapter outlines the theory of the bootstrap, provides numerical illustrations of its performance, and gives simple instructions on how to implement the bootstrap in applications. The presentation is informal and expository. Its aim is to provide an intuitive understanding of how the bootstrap works and a feeling for its practical value in econometrics."
